_Makes almost 1 quart (1 liter)_

## Ingredients

### For Caramelized Cornflakes (makes 18 oz; recipe adapted from Momofuku)

- 10 oz cornflakes
- 2 oz nonfat dry milk powder
- 4 tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 6,5 oz (one and a half stick) unsalted butter, melted

### For Cereal Milk (approximately 1 cup):

- 4 cups whole milk
- 14 oz caramelized cornflakes

### For Cereal Milk Ice Cream (makes approximately 3,5 cups):

- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup cereal milk
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 4 large egg yolks
- 4 oz caramelized cornflakes, to serve

### Method

1. To prepare the caramelized cornflakes, preheat your oven to 275 F (140 C). Put the cornflakes in a large mixing bowl and crush them with your hands a few times. Combine milk powder, sugar and salt in another bowl, give it a stir and set aside. Add the melted butter to the cornflakes and then the sugar mixture and toss to combine. Spread out on two baking sheets lined with parchment paper and bake in the preheated oven until they caramelize, for approximately 35 minutes. Remove and let cool to room temperature.
1. To prepare the cereal milk, combine 14 oz of caramelized cornflakes and milk in a large mixing bowl and let steep for an hour. Strain the milk with the help of a fine-mesh sieve (make sure to press on the cornflakes with a spatula to extract as much liquid as possible), strain once again (through a finer sieve or cheesecloth this time), pour it in a container and set aside.
   To prepare the cereal milk ice cream, pour the heavy cream in a medium bowl and place it in the fridge until needed. Combine cereal milk, sugar, salt and vanilla extract in a small pot and bring to a boil over medium heat.
1. In the meantime, in a medium pot, whisk together egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm milk mixture into the yolks while whisking constantly. Place over medium heat and stir until the mixture coats the back of a wooden spoon.
1. Pour the custard through a strainer into the chilled heavy cream and stir to combine.
1. Chill the mixture overnight, then freeze it in your ice cream machine according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
1. Serve with the remaining caramelized cornflakes.
